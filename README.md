R Portfolio Project Using Online Retailer Data

R Portfolio Project
Note: The Portfolio Project goal is twofold: (1) work on a data analytics project; (2) have the option of using this Portfolio Project in your Capstone class later on and in your job interviews. 

You have a milestone for this project in Module 4.  Make sure you use the feedback from your instructor as you complete your portfolio project.

The main requirement of the project is that it exercises concepts covered in this course. The Portfolio Project involves the following:

Select and use some Large Datasets (in the Course Resources folder)
Process the data using R
Calculate R summary statistics
Perform test for Hypotheses for a two-sample t test
Following the GitHub Upload instruction sheet, upload your finished project to GitHub
Determine how to interpret results and reach the right conclusions
Determine the question(s) you are addressing
Plan and build a system for storing, querying, or otherwise managing the data
Produce some graphs to support your analysis
If you like, create other interesting visualizations
Discover interesting relationships or phenomena from your data
Solve a real problem, do something practically useful or desirable, etc.
Your written Portfolio Project should meet the following requirements:

State any preliminary work on obtaining the data.
Describe the data activities (filtering, cleansing, etc. if any were done).
State your thoughts for planned analysis and expected results.
Present the analytics question(s) you are addressing.
Describe what interesting relationships or phenomena you have discovered or guess you will discover. If for any reason you are not able to conduct your data analytics, state the reason, then guestimate the possible discovery from the data on your analytics questions.
You will produce a seven- to ten-page report documenting your actions on data, findings, and how you did each of the above items.
Refer to the SAS and R Installation Instruction Sheets in the Course Resources folder for installation instructions and links to documentation and additional information about these programs.
